3.0.0:
-------

🐒🎉🐒🎉🐒🎉

This release comes with some big improvements to the monkeyc🐵 syntax package!

The big highlights are:
* Full Toybox coverage * - just about every module and class have highlight definitions (up to CIQ 3.0)
* Autocomplete and Snippets * - Autocomplete all Toybox namespace, and helpers for common code blocks
* Added support for Jungle files


In a future release, look forward to SDK integration with:
- Integrate monkeyc compiler call into Sublime Build system
- Add simulator running to Sublime Build System
- Run No Evil and unit test running
- Developer key generation


C H A N G E L O G
------------------

Enhancement:
- Autocomplete definitions for simple words now included
- Snippets for common blocks (module, class, do, if) and common things like Sytstem.println, Lang.Method
- expanded highlight API coverage
- Jungle syntax definition
- Include classes and modules and labels in symbol list (for Goto: symbols, Ctrl+r)
- Enable Comment toggling (Ctrl+/ or Ctrl+Shift+/) in monkeyc and jungle files
- add syntax def for objects and properties (e.g. foo.bar )

Fix:
- += and -= not registering as a single operator
- allow floats specified without period, but with explicit cast: 5f
- make annotations (:label) register as labels to sublime (for goto-like referencing)
- comments highlighted correctly in more complex places
- add scope resolution definitions to syntax: self, me, $.
- builtin methods now highlight correctly (e.g. myvar.toString())

Internal:
- better block scope detection (functions, classes, if, for, while..)
- better full-statement syntax scopes ("using X as..")
- much better annotation (:test) (:minSdk("2.3.0")) support
- better function-call syntax
