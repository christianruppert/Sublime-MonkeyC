Internal:
- better block scope detection (functions, classes, if, for, while..)

Fix:
- += and -= not registering as a single operator
- allow floats specified without period, but with explicit cast: 5f
- make labels (:label) register as labels to sublime (for goto-like referencing)
- comments highlighted correctly in more complex places

Enhancement:
- Autocomplete definitions now included
- expanded API coverage
- Jungle syntax definition
- Include classes and modules and labels in symbol list (for Goto: symbols)
- Enable Comment toggling (Ctrl+/ or Ctrl+Shift+/) in monkeyc and jungle files
