-------

🐒🎉🐒🎉🐒🎉

This release comes with some big improvements to the monkeyc🐵 syntax package!

The big highlights are:
* Autocomplete * - the package now includes autocomplete definitions
* Nearly full API coverage* - almost all Toybox classes and modules are covered

C H A N G E L O G
------------------

Enhancement:
- Autocomplete definitions now included
- expanded API coverage
- Jungle syntax definition
- Include classes and modules and labels in symbol list (for Goto: symbols, Ctrl+r)
- Enable Comment toggling (Ctrl+/ or Ctrl+Shift+/) in monkeyc and jungle files

Fix:
- += and -= not registering as a single operator
- allow floats specified without period, but with explicit cast: 5f
- make labels (:label) register as labels to sublime (for goto-like referencing)
- comments highlighted correctly in more complex places

Internal:
- better block scope detection (functions, classes, if, for, while..)
