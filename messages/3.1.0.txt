3.1.0:
-------
🔨🐵🍌 👷‍♀️ 

This is the SDK Integration Release. You can now build, simulate, and test all through sublime!

Go to Preferences > Package Settings > MonkeyC > Settings, and set up the path to your downloaded Connect IQ SDK. If you already have a developer key, set the path to that as well. If you don't have a key yet, no worries! Go to Tools > MonkeyC > Generate Developer Key, and it'll create one for you and set the path.

Now you can build away! You can perform simple builds with the Sublime Build system. Simply hit `ctrl-b` or go to Tools > Build. Or Command Palette: MonkeyC: Build Project.

Check out the full command list (Simulate, Unit Test, Package for release, etc) in the Command Palette, by typing "MonkeyC:".


In the next release, look out for: Debugger support!
- breakpoints
- stepping
- memory inspection
